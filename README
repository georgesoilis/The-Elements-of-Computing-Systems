Chapter 1:

Creating basic components of circuits in a hardware definition language.

These can be found in the chips folder. Contained are the .hdl files that
define the components, .tst files from the book's resources, .cmp files that
form part of the tests and .out files which show the results of running these
tests against the components. The .hdl files are my attempts at solutions.
